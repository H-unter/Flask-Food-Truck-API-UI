# Flask Food Truck API 

Made using Python, Flask and SQL for a year 12 assignment (2021)

I've cleaned the code up a little from its original state, and it was shocking. It was clear I should have started making
it pretty once all the features were fully realised

The app accesses the Brisbane food trucks API and stores the data locally into a SQL database. The rest of the program
is a pretty interface for this data as well as adding in a review system - for more information on the functionality see
the documentation, specifically `Digital Solutions Assignment.pdf` which was my attempt at mark farming for the
assignment but also clarifies some things. I also included `Data structure.pdf`as it nicely illustrates the type of data the API provides.

The following is a cherry-picked example - the social media hyperlink buttons rarely worked as intended
